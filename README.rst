Infernux maintenance fork
------------------------

This is an upstream-derived dependency of the
`Infernux game engine <https://github.com/ChenlizheMe/Infernux>`_'s CPU JIT work.
It is not a Taichi backend or an Infernux plugin. The original llvmlite API,
copyright notices and license remain in place; upstream documentation follows.

The ``infernux-support`` branch is the sole maintained Infernux mainline.
It is based on the upstream ``v0.49.0`` release, matching Numba 0.67's
``llvmlite>=0.49,<0.50`` requirement. Infernux builds use a local version
suffix (``0.49.0+infernux.N``), not a renamed import package. Other upstream
branches and tags are reference snapshots, not additional Infernux release
lines. This CPU dependency is not a substitute for the GPU compiler.

Build wheels with the upstream ``python setup.py bdist_wheel`` command and
LLVM 22's CMake package on ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``. Run the binding tests and
Infernux CPU JIT tests against the installed wheel before promotion. Do not
copy an experimental DLL into an existing editor environment. These wheels
retain the ``llvmlite`` distribution name; they are not published into the
upstream project's PyPI namespace. Engine dependency/channel integration and
non-Windows validation remain separate release gates.

Release wheels also carry ``NOTICE.runtime`` and the licenses of the native
compression libraries included by wheel repair. Windows wheels include the
Microsoft runtime license separately; it is not covered by the fork's BSD
license. Keep this inventory aligned with the actual repaired wheel when
updating the LLVM toolchain.

Windows packaging reads UTF-8 metadata explicitly. DLL load diagnostics keep
the UTF-8 filename separate from LLVM 22's ANSI system-error suffix, so localized
Windows installations report the original load failure without a decoding error.

The changes here repair native optimization-pass disposal and release the
instrumentation callbacks owned by each PassBuilder. Regression tests check
that closing a pass manager invokes its native destructor exactly once.
MCJIT engines also expose ``memory_statistics``: current and peak mapped bytes
for code/data pages, including allocator padding. Both existing memory-manager
choices retain their allocation behavior; the counters follow the engine's
lifetime without a process-global tracking table. These are not total RSS or
compiler IR measurements. The original C creation entry point is retained.
These fixes do not by themselves implement an executable-code memory budget.
Infernux's dispatcher retirement work is separate. The fork is not yet the
dependency installed by the public Infernux wheel.

这是 `Infernux 游戏引擎 <https://github.com/ChenlizheMe/Infernux>`_ 为 CPU JIT
维护的 llvmlite 分支，不是插件，也不参与 Taichi 的 Vulkan 编译路径。
当前修改针对 LLVM 优化资源的释放问题，保留上游 API、版权与许可证。
MCJIT 新增实际代码/数据映射页的当前与峰值字节统计，包含分配器对齐开销；
沿用现有两种内存管理器，不另建全局对象表。统计不等于进程总内存或编译器 IR 占用。
这些修复不等于完整的机器码内存管理已经完成；公开的引擎 wheel 暂未切换到此分支。

A Lightweight LLVM Python Binding for Writing JIT Compilers
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. _llvmpy: https://github.com/llvmpy/llvmpy

llvmlite is a project originally tailored for Numba_'s needs, using the
following approach:

* A small C wrapper around the parts of the LLVM C++ API we need that are
  not already exposed by the LLVM C API.
* A ctypes Python wrapper around the C API.
* A pure Python implementation of the subset of the LLVM IR builder that we
  need for Numba.

Why llvmlite
============

The old llvmpy_  binding exposes a lot of LLVM APIs but the mapping of
C++-style memory management to Python is error prone. Numba_ and many JIT
compilers do not need a full LLVM API.  Only the IR builder, optimizer,
and JIT compiler APIs are necessary.

Key Benefits
============

* The IR builder is pure Python code and decoupled from LLVM's
  frequently-changing C++ APIs.
* Materializing a LLVM module calls LLVM's IR parser which provides
  better error messages than step-by-step IR building through the C++
  API (no more segfaults or process aborts).
* Most of llvmlite uses the LLVM C API which is small but very stable
  (low maintenance when changing LLVM version).
* The binding is not a Python C-extension, but a plain DLL accessed using
  ctypes (no need to wrestle with Python's compiler requirements and C++ 11
  compatibility).
* The Python binding layer has sane memory management.
* llvmlite is faster than llvmpy thanks to a much simpler architecture
  (the Numba_ test suite is twice faster than it was).

Compatibility
=============

llvmlite has been tested with Python 3.10 -- 3.14 and is likely to work with
greater versions.

As of version 0.48.0, llvmlite requires LLVM 22.x.x on all architectures
